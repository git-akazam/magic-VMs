echo "How Do I Play Jumpchain?
Jumpchain is a single-player "Choose Your Own Adventure" (CYOA) type game. Exactly how you play it will depend on what you enjoy and get out of it.
Like a normal CYOA, you will be presented with a wide range of options in a format called a Jump (link). Once you are finished making the choices presented in the Jump, you will have completed a Build (link). However, the standard format for jumping usually assumes your Jumper will remain in that setting for ten years, and this is where you are free to imagine what happens during this time.
As a first and foremost, a single-player experience, it is most uncommon to see more than one Jumper travelling together, not to mention the frowning at such things depending on which community you come from.
Basic Rules
Basic assumption is your 'jumper' starts as 'the real you' - the person reading this.
Typically you are set on your journey by a Benefactor, whom most people refer to as Jump-Chan, proceeding to the next part.
As you do your first Jump, you begin with the Choice Points (commonly called CP) the jump document lists (Commonly one thousand points), and you, the jumper, may select from the options that jump presents you, which includes Origins (Which selectively gives you a set of memories and perhaps people you got from said Origin), Perks (Which may or not be Super Powers, depending on said jump or how the file is articulated, varying from being pretty to be incorruptible), Items (Which can range a lot, from simple money, to a castle.), Companions (Which can be told more right here).
You have to stay alive on the Jump for 10 whole years (More than not, with some exceptions such as the Devil Survivor Jump, which makes you stay there for only a week to Jumps like Stellaris, where you spend at least five centuries if you don't complete the other objectives earlier).
If you die during your stay, you are sent home with your perks, your memories and companions as a prize for entertaining Jump-chan as far as you did.
At the end of your stay, you will have three choices:
Stay in the universe you were in, leaving you there to do whatever you wanted, though it's pretty hard to see a Jumper do so.
Go home to the universe you originated from, keeping all the options you selected, another unlikely choice.
Move to the next jump, which is what creates a chain... of jumps... hence the name Jumpchain.
You are incapable of storing CP for the next Jump, so if you take a vacation jump, make sure that you use all of that CP, because it's not coming back.
You can keep anything that is purchased with cp, stored in your cosmic warehouse (optionally, that your jumper carries on their person as well), but can't bring anything that isn't stored that way.
What’s the point?
The point is for your jumper to eventually be able to earn something called a Spark: an ultimate reward that allows you to travel the multiverses without your benefactor's aid. Sparks are only offered in very limited circumstances, the End Jumps, which are, in most cases, pretty hard scenarios which would take a lot of effort and sacrifice (If you don't cheese it, that is.)
Optional Rules
Houserules! While there are already existing rules, Jumpchain is still at it's heart a singleplayer experience, just like tabletop games, you do not necessarily need to adhere to every single rule here or the ones that were done by Quicksilver.
